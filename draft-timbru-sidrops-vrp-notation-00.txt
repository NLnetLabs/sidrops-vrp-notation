1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   This informational document defines a human readable notation for
   Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs) [RFC6811].

   We provide this notation because it can can help to create
   consistency between RPKI Relying Party software output, making it
   easier for operators to compare results.  It can also be used by RPKI
   Certificate Authorities (CA) command line interfaces and/or
   configuration.  E.g. allowing a CA to provide a listing of intended
   VRPs which can be easily compared to RP output.  Our final goal is
   that this will be helpful for documentation.

   That said, this document is informational.  Implementations can
   choose to use their own notation styles instead of, or in addition to
   this.

3.  VRP Notation Definition

   This specification uses ABNF syntax specified in [RFC5234].

3.1.  roa-prefix

   This field denotes a single Validated ROA Prefix (VRP) as defined in
   section 2 of [RFC6811].  VRPs consist of either an IPv4 or an IPv6
   prefix using CIDR prefix notation, optionally followed by a max-
   length value.

   Unfortunately we could not find pre-existing formal ABNF syntax
   specifications for IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR prefix notation.  The fairly
   basic specifications defined above cover the notation of valid CIDR
   prefixes, but it should be noted that they also allow for the
   notation of invalid IPv6 addresses, and allow for prefix length
   values that are not applicable to the base IP address.  Rather than
   trying to define these rule in detail here we refer to section 3.1 of
   [RFC4632] for guidelines on IPv4 CIDR notation and section 2.3 of
   [RFC4291] for IPv6.

   If the max-length is specified then its value needs to be the same as
   or longer than the length of the prefix within the bounds applicable
   to the address family of the prefix.  If it is omitted then the
   effective max-length for the VRP will be the same as the VPR prefix
   length.

3.2.  origin-asn

   This field can optionally be prepended with the string "AS" followed
   by a decimal value of a 32 bit Autonomous System Number using the
   asplain presentation as specified in [RFC5396].  Decimal values MUST
   be used, and values MUST be part of the range 0-4294967295.
